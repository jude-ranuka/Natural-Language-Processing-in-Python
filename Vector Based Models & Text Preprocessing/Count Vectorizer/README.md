# BBC News Text Classification

Welcome to the "BBC News Text Classification" project, where your natural language processing skills are put to the test. Explore how to categorize news articles into predefined topics using a dataset of BBC news articles. Are you ready to challenge your machine learning abilities?

ðŸš€ **Getting Started**  
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, sklearn

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repo to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jude-ranuka/Natural-Language-Processing-in-Python/tree/main/Vector%20Based%20Models%20%26%20Text%20Preprocessing/Count%20Vectorizer
   ```
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas sklearn notebook
   ```

ðŸŽ® **How to Execute**  
When you run the Jupyter notebook, you'll interact with:

- The `bbc_news_dataset.csv` which contains news articles and their categories.
- The `Count Vectorizer.ipynb` notebook that guides you through loading the dataset, preprocessing the text, and training a classification model.

Steps to follow:

- Open Jupyter Notebook:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```
- Navigate to the `Count Vectorizer.ipynb` and execute the cells to train the model and see the text classification in action.

ðŸ“¦ **Built With**

- **Python** - The programming language used.
- **Pandas** - Library used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn** - Library used for machine learning and predictive data analysis.
